# foulplay

a euclidean sample instrument with trigger conditions.
based on tehn/playfair.

samples can be loaded via PARAMETERS in the main menu.

## home

when first starting foulplay you will be greeted with 8 tracks for euclidean rhythms. this is **home**. 

- ENC1 selects which track to focus.
- ENC2 sets the number of hits.
- ENC3 sets the track length.
- KEY2 starts and stops the clock.

---

## track edit

holding KEY1 will bring up the **track edit** screen, releasing KEY1 will return **home**.

**track edit** is where you will find trigger conditions and probability settings, as well as various track specific parameters.

in **track edit** parameters 1-3 are tied to their respective encoders.

- KEY2 advances to the next track.
- KEY3 advances to the next **track edit** page.

## global edit

holding KEY3 will bring up the **global edit** screen, releasing KEY3 will return **home**.

- ENC1 sets the mix volume level.
- ENC3 sets the bpm.
- KEY2 resets the phase of all tracks.

# extended explanations

### trig logic & probability

on page 2 of **track edit** you will find the trig logic and probability settings.

- ENC1 selects which logic to use. either **none**, **and**, **or**, **nand**, **nor**, or **xor**.
- ENC2 selects which track to apply the logic to. you must have trig logic turned on to access this one.
- ENC3 sets the trig probability. this is also applied to logic derived trigs.
